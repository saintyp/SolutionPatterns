    <p class="bodyText">The cloud design principles outline the characteristics of an application that we want to follow. They are based on both the lifespar and 12 factor models but are tailored to our organisational needs.
        </p>
	<p class="bodyText">Use the principles when designing your application to produce a solution that is tailored towards cloud native practices.
